Data-powered applications are a lot and this number is believed to increase for the decades to come. From search engines to recommendations systems, images and videos applications to text understanding applications, etc, data-applications has taken a huge place in the lives of many people. Teams (data scientists and software engineers) in charge of building these applications are usually eager to collect any type of data and use them for analysis, prediction models and sometimes sharing (for data science competitions purposes for example). Data collection breaches have been documented in the past years and have shown this massive operation is not totally harmless for the end-users of this applications.

Existing scientific litterature have shown differential privacy is an effective way to ensure users information protection in machine learning applications. The technique has been pionneered by Cynthia Dwork since the early 2000's and is receiving a lot of attention in the community lately. Some of big players in AI ground (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung) have productionize it to preserve users privacy. Applying this idea, I will try to preserve users information in a database using machine learning to analyse and predict.

## _Differential Privacy in a nutshell_

this massive data usage is not totally harmless for the end-users.
A well known statistic informs us that one-third of US populations can be fully retrieved using the ZIP code, date of birth and ... This simply means, people's informations cannot feel priv
Machine Learning applications collect and operate on a broad range of data. In a need to be collecting data, these applications These data can be sensitive in many cases (such as medical data or dating) and can be potentially harmful to individuals if revealed widely. The increasing need for individual data protection
