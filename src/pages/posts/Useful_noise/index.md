There are a lot of data-powered applications and this number is believed to increase for the decades to come. From search engines to recommendations systems, images and videos applications to text understanding applications, etc, data-applications has taken a huge place in the lives of many people. Teams (data scientists, software engineers and subject-matter experts) in charge of building these applications are usually eager to collect any type of data and use them for analysis, prediction models and sometimes sharing (for data science competitions purposes for example). However, breaches have been documented in the past years and have shown the massive collection is not totally harmless to the end-users of this applications.

Existing scientific litterature had proven **differential privacy** is an effective way to ensure users information protection in machine learning applications. The technique has been pionneered by Cynthia Dwork since the early 2000's and has received a lot of attention in the community ever since. Some of the big players in AI ground (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung) have productionize it to preserve users privacy. This technique can clearly help fill the trust gap between curators and users. **_Applying this idea, I will try to preserve users information in a database using machine learning to analyse and predict._**

## _Differential Privacy in a nutshell_

Differential Privacy (DP) is a mechanism designed to protect information of individuals through a randomized process. Concretely, it introduces noise into the data in order to retain information from an attacker (any individual who might want to access information that is not intended to be disclosed). There exists two forms of DP:

- the (classical) DP in which data is collected from every individuals and aggregated into a single database; the noise is then introduced in an aggregated result of the collected data before publishing.
- the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) in which the noise is introduced in every individual data before centralization by the aggregator. This setting brings stronger privacy guarantees than the previous one as individuals do not have to trust the aggregator.

The promise of DP is to ensure the plausible deniability of a user's information. It means, we will not
